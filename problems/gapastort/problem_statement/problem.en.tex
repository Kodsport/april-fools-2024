It's time for a dental visit! 
Your dentist happens to be interested in both DNA strands and problem-solving. 
While the dentist is busy tinkering with your teeth, they give you the following problem.

You are given an $N$ long substring of a DNA string, where all $N$ characters are guaranteed to be one of \texttt{G}, \texttt{T}, \texttt{C}, or \texttt{A}.

You want to find another DNA substring of length $N$ that differs from the given DNA string at each position.

Can you find the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order}{lexicographically} smallest of all these possible DNA strings?


\section*{Input}
\noindent
The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000$).
\noindent
The second line contains a string with $N$ characters, where all characters are either \texttt{G}, \texttt{T}, \texttt{C}, or \texttt{A}.

\section*{Output}
\noindent
Write out a string with $N$ characters, where all characters must be \texttt{G}, \texttt{T}, \texttt{C}, or \texttt{A}. 
This string should differ from the given string at every position.



\section*{Points}
You can recieve up to 100 points depending on how well you solve the problem.

\textbf{Note:} In this problem, the size of the file you submit cannot exceed 1 kB.

\section*{Grading}
You can get from 0 up to 100 points. If you submit exactly at \href{https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Ready+yourself%2C+Cowboy&iso=20240401T12&p1=239}{High Noon} 
($12:00:00$ Swedish time), then you get 100 points. If you submit before that, you get 0 points. For every second after $12:00:00$ you submit, you will recieve 1 point less. 

For example, if you submit at $12:00:05$, you will only get $95$ points. If you submit at $12:01:00$, you will only get $40$ points.
But if you submit at $12:30:00$, you will get $0$ points.

oh i remember the problem now.



uh so there are N numbers probably, i don't really remember

and they all have a value between 0 and $10^{.^9}$.

oh btw don't forget that the first row contains one single integer $N$, and after that we have the $N$ integers on a seperate row.


and the goal with the problem was to, um, something. 


it was something about finding the smallest number such that some condition was held, i don't really remember... but i swear this was the problem...

it is really similar to a problem that i have made before, and it's probably on kattis. almost identical

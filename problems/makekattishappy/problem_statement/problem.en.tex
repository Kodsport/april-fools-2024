\section*{Interaction}
You have 10 different actions you can do:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pour 10 ml of milk infront of Kattis.
  \item Pet Kattis (Softly)
  \item Pet Kattis (Hard).
  \item Say ``Meow'' to Kattis.
  \item Make Kattis wear some sick \href{https://www.amazon.se/kostymer-roliga-husdjur-kattunge-outfits/dp/B08XX7W5F9}{cat clothes}.
  \item Give Kattis a high-five.
  \item Watch cat-videos on Youtube together Kattis. (For example this \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh9oLs67Cw}{video} which Joshua has linked on his Discord)
  \item Use a laserpointer and get Kattis to chase it.
  \item Feed Kattis some cat candy.
  \item Give Kattis some catnip.
\end{enumerate}

You can do up to 20 actions after eachother. You are allowed to repeat the same actions.
To preform an action, output the action's number on a single line. For example, to pet Kattis softly, 
and then pour 10 ml of milk infront of Kattis, you'll have to output \texttt{2} on a line, and then \texttt{1} on a seperate line.
Make sure not to write too many actions on a single line. You do not want to make Kattis even more sad.

Your actions will be preformed one after another. If you manage to make Kattis upset to some specific degree,
then your program will get terminated and you get \texttt{Wrong Answer} immediately.
You will also get \texttt{Wrong Answer} if you write something that is not one of the 10 mentioned alternatives,
since exact these 10 options are the only options that Kattis might like.

When you manage to make Kattis happy, your remaining actions will get ignored.


\textbf{Make sure to flush the output after each action}, otherwise you can get \textit{Time Limit Exceeded}.
In C++ this can be done using \texttt{cout << flush;}
or \texttt{fflush(stdout);}
in Python with \texttt{stdout.flush()},
and in Java with \texttt{System.out.flush();}.

\problemname{Easy Query}
\noindent

This problem is easy! You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \leq l < r \leq 10^9$), and your task
is to count how many numbers $x$ satisfy $l < x < r$.
\
\
Did we forget to mention that $x$ can be any 32-bit floating point number as defined by the
\href{https://sci-hub.3800808.com/10.1109/ieeestd.2008.4610935}{IEE 754 standard?}


\section*{Input}
\noindent
The only input is integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \leq l < r \leq 10^9$).

\section*{Output}
\noindent
Print an integer: the number of 32-bit floats $x$ that satisfy $l < x < r$.


\section*{Points}
If you correctly answer all testcases, you will earn 100 points.

\section*{Sample 1}
Note that the floats 1 and 2 are excluded.
